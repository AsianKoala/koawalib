## koawalib
koawalib is an FTC library written by Neil Mehra, member of team 14607. 
The goal of this library is to enable teams of all levels to perform at a sufficient degree without 
programming knowledge/experience being a limiting factor. Shoutout to [wpilib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib)
and [technolib](https://github.com/technototes/TechnoLib) for inspiration.

## Installation
- Add the following lines in the repositories block of  ```build.dependencies.gradle```:
```
repositories {
...
  maven { url = 'https://maven.brott.dev/' }
  maven { url = 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```
- Then in your ```/TeamCode/build.gradle``` add this line to your ```dependencies``` block, where "0.0.4" is the newest release version number
```
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.AsianKoala:koawalib:0.0.4'
}
```
